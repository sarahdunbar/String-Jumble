Assignment:

The purpose of this challenge is to gain proficiency with 
manipulating lists.

Write and submit a Python program that accepts a string from 
the user and prints it back in three different ways:

* With all letters in reverse.
* With words in reverse order, but letters within each word in 
  the correct order.
* With all words in correct order, but letters reversed within 
  the words.

Output of your program should look like this:

Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better): There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy
You entered "There are a few techniques or tricks that you may find handy". Now jumble it:
ydnah dnif yam uoy taht skcirt ro seuqinhcet wef a era erehT
handy find may you that tricks or techniques few a are There
erehT era a wef seuqinhcet ro skcirt taht uoy yam dnif ydnah
"""

string = input("Please enter a string of text (the bigger the better):")
strlist = string.split(" ")
r = len(strlist)
z = r*2
for x in range(z):
    if x == (z-1):
        break
    if x%2 == 1:
        strlist.insert(x, " ")
    else:
        m = 1
for p in range(0, (r*2 - 1)):
    g = strlist[p]
    i = list(g)
    strlist[p] = i
print(strlist)
two = sorted(strlist, reverse=True)
print (two)
for p in range(0, (r*2 - 1)):
    g = strlist[p]
    strlist[p] = sorted(g, reverse=True)


#strlistrev = sorted(strlist1, reverse = True)
#print ("".join(strlistrev))

#strlist = string.split(" ")
#print(strlist)
